# Toward an Embodied Intelligence System: Hierarchical Abstraction and World Modeling via Vector Memory

## Abstract
This paper proposes an architecture for developing an embodied, human-like intelligent agent using a vector-based memory system. Instead of combining vector databases with explicit graph structures, this system encodes and stores all multimodal sensory experiences as vectors and allows higher-level abstractions and relationships to emerge from their geometric arrangement in vector space. Concepts, identities, and world models are learned from interaction and observation, and simulation engines like MuJoCo are used to ground predictions in physical reality. This approach is contrasted with current state-of-the-art methods such as LLMs, V-JEPA, and symbolic graph systems. We present the advantages, challenges, and a proposed roadmap for implementation.

## 1. Introduction
Human intelligence relies on grounded, multimodal experience: we see, hear, touch, smell, and interact with our environment. Yet modern AI systems like large language models (LLMs) operate largely on symbolic text, with limited grounding in sensory experience. This paper explores an alternative paradigm — an intelligent system that stores all sensory input in a vector database, without an explicit graph, allowing hierarchies and concepts to emerge from vector operations and similarities.

The foundation of this model is simple: each unit of sensory input is encoded into a vector and stored. For example, the sound of a person’s voice, their facial appearance, their scent, and the sensation of touch can all be stored as separate but related vectors. These individual vectors can then be aggregated into an identity vector (e.g., for a person like "mother"), which in turn becomes a basis for more abstract concepts and reasoning. However, we acknowledge that simple averaging may not capture multimodal binding and will discuss more nuanced alternatives.

## 2. Concept Overview
### 2.1 Vector-Centric Memory
Each sensory input (image, audio, touch, smell) is encoded into a vector via appropriate modality-specific encoders (e.g., CLIP, Wav2Vec, tactile sensors). These vectors are stored in a vector database such as FAISS, Milvus, or Weaviate with metadata such as time, context, and modality. Each sensory vector acts as a node with implicit relational meaning through geometric proximity and clustering.
```python
v_face = encode_image(face_image)
v_voice = encode_audio(voice_clip)
v_touch = encode_touch(tactile_array)
v_smell = encode_smell(odor_signature)

# Store each vector with metadata
store_vector(v_face, modality="vision", timestamp=t1)
store_vector(v_voice, modality="audio", timestamp=t1)
store_vector(v_touch, modality="touch", timestamp=t1)
store_vector(v_smell, modality="smell", timestamp=t1)

```

### 2.2 Implicit Concept Nodes and Identity Construction
When multiple sensory experiences are related (e.g., hearing a voice, seeing a face, feeling a hug), they are associated through spatial similarity and temporal co-occurrence. A higher-level identity vector can be formed using mechanisms beyond averaging, such as attention-weighted compositions or learned vector binding methods like Holographic Reduced Representations (HRRs) or Tensor Product Representations (TPRs). These methods help preserve modality distinctions and relative importance.
```python
# Identity composition using attention-weighted aggregation
v_entity = weighted_average([v_sound, v_vision, v_touch, v_smell], weights=[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1])
```
This identity vector becomes a meaningful reference that can be accessed through any one of its modalities or through abstract labels (e.g., the word "mother").

We also recognize that vector addition is commutative and may not preserve syntactic relationships (e.g., agent-verb-object). Structured binding techniques or additional control vectors may be required to preserve grammar and logic in abstractions.
```python
# Agent-action binding with syntactic structure
v_event = bind(agent=v_mother, action=v_walk)  # Not simple vector addition
```

### 2.3 Hierarchical Abstractions and Configuration Logic
Higher-level abstract concepts (e.g., "family") can be formed through clustering and vector composition. For physical structures (e.g., a table composed of four legs and a panel), spatial configurations must be encoded explicitly.

We propose to encode these as structured metadata within each vector entry, making this a hybrid vector-symbolic memory. While the graph is not hand-engineered, it emerges from learned spatial, temporal, and semantic associations stored as metadata alongside vectors.
```python
# Representation of a table from part vectors
v_leg = encoder(leg_image)
v_panel = encoder(panel_image)
v_table = combine([v_panel] + repeat(v_leg, 4), config="4 legs, 1 top")
```
To support concept formation, we recommend using robust clustering techniques such as HDBSCAN rather than KMeans, which can suffer from noise and parameter sensitivity.
```python
from hdbscan import HDBSCAN
clusters = HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=5).fit(vectors)
v_family = average(vectors[clusters.labels_ == cluster_id])
```

### 2.4 Simulation Integration and World Modeling
The system can observe sequences of sensory frames, such as a ball falling onto a table, and attempt to reconstruct and simulate these events. For example:
- Detect object geometries from images (e.g., ball and table).
- Construct a scene in MuJoCo with estimated mass and position (e.g., ball 10cm above table).
- Simulate gravity and compare resulting frame with the next observed video frame.
- Adjust simulation parameters (mass, velocity) to reduce error.
- Save the dynamic interaction as a predictive memory: "If a ball is placed above a table, it will fall unless supported."

This enables the system to learn physical laws through observation and simulation, and reuse them in future inferences.

We acknowledge that mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is an open problem in inverse graphics. We propose starting with simplified domains using known 3D object libraries, or human-annotated scene reconstructions.
```python
# Scene setup from stored vectors
scene_objects = [retrieve_vector("ball"), retrieve_vector("table")]
scene_config = build_3d_scene(scene_objects)
```
```python
# Pseudo-code for hybrid simulation
if scene_complexity < threshold:
    prediction = simulate_2d(scene, physics_params)
else:
    prediction = simulate_mujoco(scene, physics_params)
```

The feedback loop between simulation and perception (e.g., adjusting mass/velocity in MuJoCo to match observed video) will require optimization tools. We suggest using differentiable physics engines like Brax or DiffTaichi or reinforcement learning to reduce prediction error and build a predictive dynamics model.
```python
# Reinforcement learning for simulation tuning
state = v_scene
action = adjust_params(mass, velocity)
reward = -mse(simulated_frame, real_frame)
policy = rl_agent(state, action, reward)
```

### 2.5 Temporal Dynamics and Event Formation
To model sequences and causal relations, we propose using transformers over temporal sensory inputs.
```python
# Temporal encoding of an event like “ball falling”
sequence = [v_t1, v_t2, v_t3]  # e.g., sequential sensory frames
temporal_embedding = transformer(sequence)
v_event = aggregate(temporal_embedding)
```
This allows the system to distinguish between states like "ball is falling" and "ball has fallen," based on sequence and change over time.

### 2.6 Abstract vs. Grounded Thinking
The system can think at varying levels of detail:
- **Low-level**: Full simulation using 3D physics engines (eg. MuJoCo).
- **Intermediate**: Reconstruct keyframes in 3D or 2D.
- **High-level**: Vector-based symbolic abstraction, enhanced with LLMs.

For instance, the phrase "mother is walking" can be interpreted by:
- Abstract reasoning: bind(agent=v_mother, action=v_walk)
- Concrete simulation: simulate walking via MuJoCo using mother’s model
```python
# Abstract representation of “mother is walking”
v_mother = retrieve_vector("mother")
v_walk = retrieve_vector("walk")
v_action = bind(agent=v_mother, action=v_walk)
```
Non-physical abstractions (e.g., "justice") can be approximated by combining related sensory contexts (e.g., courtroom, law books) with LLM embeddings to form a hybrid representation.
```python
v_justice_symbolic = llm_embed("justice")
v_justice_sensory = average([v_courtroom, v_law_book, v_judge_speech])
v_justice = combine(v_justice_symbolic, v_justice_sensory)
```

The abstraction can be also low resolution images, or simulations.

### 2.7 Evaluation and Interpretation
To assess learning and abstraction:
```python
# Abstraction quality using silhouette score
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
score = silhouette_score(vectors, clusters.labels_)

# Retrieval evaluation
retrieved = retrieve_nearest_vector(v_query)
precision, recall = evaluate_retrieval(retrieved, ground_truth)

# Visualization
projected_vectors = umap_project(vectors)
plot_2d(projected_vectors, labels=modality_types)
```
