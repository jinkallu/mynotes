# Toward an Embodied Intelligence System: Hierarchical Abstraction and World Modeling via Vector Memory

## Abstract
This paper proposes an architecture for developing an embodied, human-like intelligent agent using a vector-based memory system. Instead of combining vector databases with explicit graph structures, this system encodes and stores all multimodal sensory experiences as vectors and allows higher-level abstractions and relationships to emerge from their geometric arrangement in vector space. Concepts, identities, and world models are learned from interaction and observation, and simulation engines like MuJoCo are used to ground predictions in physical reality. This approach is contrasted with current state-of-the-art methods such as LLMs, V-JEPA, and symbolic graph systems. We present the advantages, challenges, and a proposed roadmap for implementation.

## 1. Introduction
Human intelligence relies on grounded, multimodal experience: we see, hear, touch, smell, and interact with our environment. Yet modern AI systems like large language models (LLMs) operate largely on symbolic text, with limited grounding in sensory experience. This paper explores an alternative paradigm ‚Äî an intelligent system that stores all sensory input in a vector database, without an explicit graph, allowing hierarchies and concepts to emerge from vector operations and similarities.

The foundation of this model is simple: each unit of sensory input is encoded into a vector and stored. For example, the sound of a person‚Äôs voice, their facial appearance, their scent, and the sensation of touch can all be stored as separate but related vectors. These individual vectors can then be aggregated into an identity vector (e.g., for a person like "mother"), which in turn becomes a basis for more abstract concepts and reasoning.

## 2. Concept Overview
### 2.1 Vector-Centric Memory
Each sensory input (image, audio, touch, smell) is encoded into a vector via appropriate modality-specific encoders (e.g., CLIP, Wav2Vec, tactile sensors). These vectors are stored in a vector database such as FAISS, Milvus, or Weaviate with metadata such as time, context, and modality. Each sensory vector acts as a node with implicit relational meaning through geometric proximity and clustering.

### 2.2 Implicit Concept Nodes and Identity Construction
When multiple sensory experiences are related (e.g., hearing a voice, seeing a face, feeling a hug), they are associated through spatial similarity and temporal co-occurrence. A higher-level identity vector can be formed by averaging or otherwise projecting these sensory vectors:
```python
v_entity = average([v_sound, v_vision, v_touch, v_smell])
```
This identity vector becomes a meaningful reference that can be accessed through any one of its modalities or through abstract labels (e.g., the word "mother").

### 2.3 Hierarchical Abstractions
Higher-level abstract concepts (e.g., "family") can be formed through hierarchical clustering and vector composition:
```python
v_walk = v_mother + v_action_walk
v_furniture = average([v_table, v_chair])
v_family = average([v_mother, v_father, v_sibling])
v_table = combine([v_top_panel, repeated(v_leg, 4)])
```
The idea is that complex entities like tables can be composed from configurations of simpler vectors (e.g., legs and top panel). Repetition and spatial configuration are part of the metadata stored alongside these vectors.

### 2.4 Simulation Integration and World Modeling
The system can observe sequences of sensory frames, such as a ball falling onto a table, and attempt to reconstruct and simulate these events. For example:
- Detect object geometries from images (e.g., ball and table).
- Construct a scene in MuJoCo with estimated mass and position (e.g., ball 10cm above table).
- Simulate gravity and compare resulting frame with the next observed video frame.
- Adjust simulation parameters (mass, velocity) to reduce error.
- Save the dynamic interaction as a predictive memory: "If a ball is placed above a table, it will fall unless supported."

This enables the system to learn physical laws through observation and simulation, and reuse them in future inferences.

### 2.5 Abstract vs. Grounded Thinking
The system can think at varying levels of detail:
- **Low-level**: Fully simulate 3D movement using MuJoCo.
- **Intermediate**: Reconstruct keyframes in 3D or 2D.
- **High-level**: Use vector composition and LLMs for symbolic reasoning.

For instance, the phrase "mother is walking" can be interpreted by:
- Abstract reasoning: vector composition (v_mother + v_walk)
- Concrete simulation: animating a 3D model of the mother walking in a scene

## Architecture

### 3.3 Concept Formation
- Identity vectors formed by aggregating multiple modality-specific vectors
- Abstractions formed through unsupervised clustering, averaging, and composition (e.g., KMeans)
- Configuration logic for complex objects (e.g., table = 1 top + 4 legs)
- Hierarchies are emergent: cluster centroids form higher abstractions

### 3.4 Physical Simulation Module
- MuJoCo scenes constructed from vector-derived parameters
- Simulation used to verify or generate physical world predictions

### 3.5 Language Abstraction Layer
- LLM used to name, retrieve, and reason over vector-encoded entities
- Abstract words, Tokens (e.g., "mother") map to corresponding composite (identity) vectors
- Language is a layer above the sensory grounding
